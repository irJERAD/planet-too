Not a single individual would have desired even to relive a moment sentimentally -&amp;gt; We may have even accessed eternal life or multiple heavans for us all.</description>

      <description>Do not let sentiment hold you back from destiny.
Dying is about letting go of your earthly life, possessions and people, and leaving Earth / Everything behind.
Do not feel back for those behind, because they will always hold you back.</description>
