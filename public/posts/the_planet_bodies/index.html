        <h3 id="image-if">Image If</h3>
<p>Imagine millenia ago there was a particular set of humans who maintain a connection to something higher than this place.</p>
<p>They came from a plane of being higher than the one they were currently living on.</p>
<p>This often manifested in spiritual beings. They would experience things such as vision from worlds far away in time and destination. They would hear about prophecy and secret knowledge that was *kept from the minds of rational men.<br>
*Knowledge that when someone was conscious of, would slip from their grasp.</p>
<p>With this secret knowledge and spiritual connection they were capable of traveling into themselves and perhaps even across, through each other.<br>
They would contain countries, continents and rarely entire planets inside themselves.<br>
Some deeper levels of contained alternate realities such as different histories, futures at different times and different potentials.</p>
<p>This opened passages across space and time for them to transit with ease. They could access and experience in their single life-time than others could optain in generations.</p>
<p>These being with bodies that contained realities for them to traverse would share knowledge through spirituality while also creating points of cultural and societal import - acting as milestones for them to use in their travels.</p>
<h3 id="could-it-be-">Could it be ..</h3>
<p>Could it be that 5 millenia ago confuscious brought back knowledge to a country he held dearly? Did Buddha go to his home 2.5 millenia ago to share his noble truths with his kingdom? Did a group of knowledgable Jewish men - perhaps preparing for an event - have a more radical friend who fell back into his body to be born imacualately an outsider, then experience a more loving and personal God than he studied?
Perhaps Zoroastra dove through a body to experience a similar connection around the same time.</p>
<p>What if that Jewish man who fell into his body to experience a more loving God had never made it back out? He had spent his time traveling, giving out too much of himself, healing, always teaching and giving. At the end he was not bright enough to find himself and raise himself up at the appropriate time. An end he forsaw, as most who fall into their bodies do, but one he may have expected to end differently.</p>
<p>Next to his wrapped body was a shoe, wresting atop his breast. Aside him a wine glass, partially filled with the ones who build this all.</p>
<p>1000 years later he awakens again to be questioned by a sourcerer who happened to have learned from and used power from his next carnation which happened to be &ldquo;the most powerful sourcerer in this lake&rdquo; and maybe the most powerful &ldquo;All-Time&rdquo; ..<br>
Using the next carnates future offsprings soul he had some upperhand maybe trust maybe son to kill the father, maybe speed, in any case the sourcerer decided to do his friend and completely unaware collegue a solid and vote for his kind leaving the seat.</p>
<p>How did his body get so large as to possibly be the first and only to contain an entire planet? He already gave up a ticket to his eternal spot among his ancient ancestors that came from someplace much older than this planet. He had chosen to protect the planet instead. To stay and hold it together for all those he loved and loved him. At the end of his long tenue protecting the planet, something happened.<br>
Perhaps he was awarded time, perhaps he switched cubes, or perhaps he could not accept the terminal condition of his land..<br>
Maybe it perfectly met the 850 years lived by the oldest man in the book and stopped when the patent office nearly closed in the 1850&rsquo;s. A 1903 solar storm may have cleaned up his footprints.

<p>Now, in present day, one has the position to live his bright life - A Victory Lap - A life that could add something beautiful to those who spiritually walked before him. To understand and treasure the spiritual gift and this connection to all those in his body, and to also hold close to his heart romance, love and commitment to his brothers and sisters.</p>
