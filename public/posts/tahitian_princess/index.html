        <p>In 2009 A Tahitian Princess and a young American fell in love.</p>
<p>They both lived together in San Diego. The American went to College at UCSD, the Tahitian went to college at USD.</p>
<p>They both Traveled to Tahiti in 2011. This trip was the American&rsquo;s first time in Tahiti and he loved the Island much.<br>
The Family and he enjoy Tama&rsquo;a Maitai and watched a Dance.  They traveled the island and they spent their time with their family.</p>
<p>In December of 2012 until January of 2013 they went to New Zealand for a romantic get away.</p>
<p>There they traveled the country side visiting the rolling grass hills, seeing the glow in the dark worms, and staying the night at lake Taupo.</p>
<p>Later than year, in 2013 around April or May was their first encounter with the paranormal.
Someone had used a spiritual tool to split the two of them up emotionally in order for them to sleep with the Tahitian princess.<br>
This Professor of hers from her school did not tell her, or her boy friend - The American - about what he was doing or what he was using to split the two of them up as well as to make her go with him.</p>
<p>The very next morning the Tahitian Princess messaged her American that she had wanted to die, and asked for a medicine to do it. She cried and begged, but this would be a large cut between the two.</p>
<p>It would later be found out this Professor was working with a secret group of others who used these types of tools to spiritually hurt, take advantage of, and manipulate the unaware. Attempting to take from them, their spiritual and ansestoral inheritance.</p>
<p>A similar section of the Christian Science faith had worked with them in manipulating the spiritual and occult in order to alter time and the future in their own favor, looking to instigate would be catostrophic events.</p>
<p>In 2015 the Tahitian Princess and the American reunited in San Francisco where they were married, in body and soul.<br>
Meanwhile, they continued to be hunted down by participants in this larger hidden plot to manipulate the future and the planet by using these spiritual tools without the conset of knowledge of those they were manipulating.</p>
<p>It would appear as though many hopeful young individuals may have been pressed or tested to lean toward intoxicants, homelessness and financial instability in order for this groups inner plan to take root in reality and manifest itself once certain global events were instigated.</p>
<h4 id="all-these-plans-relied-on-two-factors">All these plans relied on two factors:</h4>
<ol>
<li>The Tahitian Princess was to be married to one of their suitors in order for them to control their coming &ldquo;Reign&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The American needed to be releaved of his ancestrial right over his spirit and the crafts promised to him. All this was through his grandfather a Bishop in the Mormon Church; Hamilton, Military Officer among those responsible for the start of the airforce; His grandmother Zabinsky who was a capable of being an Olypic Swimmer.<br>
By Splitting his spiritual and spacial wealth in half in 2010, then splintering more through the Tahitian Princesses Islands and secret suitors who would use spiritual tools to trick her into subjigation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Married in San Francisco the tool and its code used to split them up and allure the Tahitian Princess into a Love Affair with even more powerful and dangerous suitors - connected with the American&rsquo;s Government at the highest level.</p>
<p>Just married and with multiple men in careers, families and positions in this spiritual movement that threatened both of their freedom and love for each other.</p>
<p>As pressure intensified on us, the American was dangerously burglered and may have survived an attempt at murder near the Spring of 2016 with his iPhone6s.<br>
Similarly, with our time in San Francisco, stress and drug usage grew at a significant growth. Eventually The American could no longer</p>
<h4 id="2018-new-zealand">2018 New Zealand</h4>
<p>After having difficulty in Los Angeles and nearly breaking up with each other due to a job she had in Long Beach - A job she did not want to accept and did not feel comfortable going into the interview; afterwhich she complained about the way she was treated in the interview, being teased for wearing her wedding ring and making fun of the last name she aqcuired through her husband.</p>
<h4 id="currently">Currently</h4>
<p>July 28, 2021 (2nd) 12:07pm, As The American types this out in hopes of showing just how much damage has occured against these two, in the name of some spiritual movement; How much damage was intended for our planet through this designed course; and how much physical damage they were constantly doing to The American&rsquo;s Body.</p>
<p>Now I sit here asking my friends and would be assialants to take a break with me, assess the information, and prepare for us to break bread and pursue our inevitable paths.<br>
Together or apart there is something large a foot.</p>
<p>Can you feel it, the biggest shift in economic and spiritual power ever experienced in man kind. We have it at our feet.</p>
