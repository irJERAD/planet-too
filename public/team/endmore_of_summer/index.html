        <p>This summer has been a difficult season. Right after the spring I stopped seeing you - I miss you, sorry we weren&rsquo;t together through everything so you could simply do your most important job on the planet, hold onto our new life while sharing my best self with everyone else.</p>
<p>It seems that before I could ever grow up in you, we had to go through our tests.<br>
You see, dreaming has a cost when others are watching. I know you only see me in everything: its either perfectly something I am like, good on part of my presence or bad / evil and bad for me.</p>
<p>Others, however, understandably interpret them selves in the dreams of others. As you can imagine, many spend their entire lives watching only their own dreams and so interpretation can be very self-centered.</p>
<p>We did get to cross our legs for a while. So many sleep filled nights our bodies slept across, near, and with. Just as we slept inside each other, we would dream inside each other.<br>
You, my eternal memory. Waking me with full accounts of what went on during our slumber. Me - always stuck in this world of the physical most of our time - only getting a few glimpses yet knowing this special nature was normal. I had walked in the dreams of others my whole life, even without being near them physically.</p>
<p>Thank you for keeping so much time with me. I know it and I am sorry it may not always be seen the way it was meant to be felt.<br>
Our gift for two - of course we could woken a world with hope and love - we could not however have woken with each other.</p>
<p>Your tap, frustration, my experiences blabbered across an ocean. Us - unable to grow together, unable to move forward.</p>
<p>We switched and I do not think anyone expected it to be so visceral. My new obsession with our connection and containing you to myself, your independence and completeness in this world while I searched for answers and a connection in the next.
We were really one. so our switching was no more than a temporary disconnect when separated. Who knows how many times this one has been split and pulled, experienced, learned; and how much effort went into setting this up; completely repairing this one so we could live bounded and allow other to be safely stowed.</p>
<p>To special people came together. One lost. One repaired. Now feeling separated for itself - a spiritual plug pulled and desiring to know and be known by a high power. Worship is the way I know to this, but prayer and encounters have not worked well lately.</p>
<p>I think Mel spelled this out. Maybe the apple grants someone the peace they need to know our better selves and wont let in any thoughts of their creative&rsquo;s loss.</p>
<p>I hope</p>
