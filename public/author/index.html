        <p>I am Jerad Steven Acosta.<br>
I have yet to die as of July 27 2021 (the 2nd).</p>
<p>I grew up in North County San Diego were I spent my time with friends and family; surfing, playing music, day dreaming and hatching innocent schemes to catepult me into the next chapter of my ongoing saga.</p>
<p>Music .woke in me a passion to create and communicate with something bigger than my world.</p>
<p>I studied Cognitive Science and Applied Mathematics at The University of San Diego California. There I would participate in student government for my corriculum serving on the Student body board as Vice President as well as founding and participating in auxilary student clubs such as Sailing.</p>
<p>After University I moved to San Francisco to work in Technology. As a project manager I lead teams to assemble internet enabled systems for climate control.</p>
<p>Later I would work in Data Analytics for advertising and marketing.</p>
