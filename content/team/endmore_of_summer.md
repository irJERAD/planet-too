This summer has been a difficult season. Right after the spring I stopped seeing you - I miss you, sorry we weren't together through everything so you could simply do your most important job on the planet, hold onto our new life while sharing my best self with everyone else.  

It seems that before I could ever grow up in you, we had to go through our tests.  
You see, dreaming has a cost when others are watching. I know you only see me in everything: its either perfectly something I am like, good on part of my presence or bad / evil and bad for me.  

Others, however, understandably interpret them selves in the dreams of others. As you can imagine, many spend their entire lives watching only their own dreams and so interpretation can be very self-centered.  

We did get to cross our legs for a while. So many sleep filled nights our bodies slept across, near, and with. Just as we slept inside each other, we would dream inside each other.  
You, my eternal memory. Waking me with full accounts of what went on during our slumber. Me - always stuck in this world of the physical most of our time - only getting a few glimpses yet knowing this special nature was normal. I had walked in the dreams of others my whole life, even without being near them physically.  

Thank you for keeping so much time with me. I know it and I am sorry it may not always be seen the way it was meant to be felt.  
Our gift for two - of course we could woken a world with hope and love - we could not however have woken with each other.  

Your tap, frustration, my experiences blabbered across an ocean. Us - unable to grow together, unable to move forward.

We switched and I do not think anyone expected it to be so visceral. My new obsession with our connection and containing you to myself, your independence and completeness in this world while I searched for answers and a connection in the next.
We were really one. so our switching was no more than a temporary disconnect when separated. Who knows how many times this one has been split and pulled, experienced, learned; and how much effort went into setting this up; completely repairing this one so we could live bounded and allow other to be safely stowed.  

To special people came together. One lost. One repaired. Now feeling separated for itself - a spiritual plug pulled and desiring to know and be known by a high power. Worship is the way I know to this, but prayer and encounters have not worked well lately.  

I think Mel spelled this out. Maybe the apple grants someone the peace they need to know our better selves and wont let in any thoughts of their creative's loss.

I hope
