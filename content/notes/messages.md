## What Are We Trying To Say  


I have been experiencing something so big the clouds cannot contain it.  

I have been awaiting something so illuminated the god of Sun has risen to witness reception.  

I have been awaiting something so timeless the moon preserves it purity.

- The Prophet  
- The Bible
    - version: New King James  
- Plaths  
- The Internet  
    - Wikipedia: history
