## Just Beside My Mind  

Thinking about some things that seem connected but have not quite mapped it out so I am starting with an etch.  


### Temporal Lobe  

When viewed from the side: the bottom back portion of the brain  

Processes time  
Processes language  

#### What is it about processing time and meaning that is interwoven?  

**Communication? Measurment?**  

Our Atmosphere has the capacity to measure information from around the universe; possibly across time as well.  


##### Measure is to observation  
Measuring the state of certain conditions such as schrodinger's cat experiment results in a finalized state. The measurement is the simple oberservation of either the cat or the quantom state of the poison's trigger.  

***However..***  
If observation is stored in the mind as memory, could we


Mirrored network for synthesized origin or directionality (origin? originality?)
- When you hear a sound a pattern across a network in the mind will be activated.  
- When you make or imagine that same sound there is a mirrored network that is formed and functions the same as when you hear it  
- Interesting to think we would use a seperate but nearly identical set of actual neurons or nodes to synthesize the hearing of something instead of reusing the same pieces with a modulous for marking their origin  
    - For example: if we use 10 neurons that express a pattern of activation associated with an auditory experience, why then would we make a second 10 neurons that express a nearly identical pattern to associate with that experience being synthesized?  
    Rather, use the same 10 neurons and the same pattern with a slight augentation to represent the synthesized nature of the signal - this would also allow for more permutations or classes of synthesized (such as imagining the sound, someone else imagining - taking care of part of the unique identity of origin issue - someones else makes it or it just becomes itself)  
- Mirror neurons could make sense from a Empathy, Sympathy, Apathy philosophical origin  
    - Proprioceptively we are able to synthesize where our body parts are and would be if we moved them  
    - Phatom limbs are caused when a limb is physically removed yet the body still receives feedback from their proprioceptive selves  
        example: you lose a limb in combat then feel it cramping up. The cramp grow terribly strong without the ability to "feel" it loosen up or releive itself.
