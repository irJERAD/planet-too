## But What Does It Mean

Walls have erected and cities built.  
People have a habit to ritualize this wealth.  
A war without a shot fired until the end was written.  
Quarantine through cast will fix the set.  

Walking the line with emotiv propulsion spins me around  

Splitting two naturals for two perfect partners  
Grows a beautiful aliance  

Afterthought what if infects with doubt
who am I?  
Where am I going?  
And what do I know?  

### To Do  

Here we are, what do we do?  
- Goal: to change those around me  
    - For their better  
    - For the better of the system  

### I have Seen This Before  

*Walk as though you are following you shadow because you have been here before.*  
    - Henock
