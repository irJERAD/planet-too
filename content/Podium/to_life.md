[*hands folded, lowers chin-to-chest*]
Thank you.  

Thank you for my day.   

Thank you for every day I have had.    

Thank you for my rest. And thank you for my wife.  

Thank you for our memories, and for each other.  

Please allow us to enjoy this day making more memories that we can cherrish.  


### Each And Every Day Is A Gift  

It can be hard to appreciate just how fortunate we are..  

We live on this giant rock spinning through space, with a sun perfectly situated just so and a moon resting outside our reach but close enough to guide our tides for a rich and comlex ecosystem along the coasts of our planets oceans.  

We simply get to wake up to our preset coffee machines, chirping at the right time.  

Reading a paper written by professionals who know just what to say and how to put it into words for you to digest.
