I am Jerad Steven Acosta.  
I have yet to die as of July 27 2021 (the 2nd).  

I grew up in North County San Diego were I spent my time with friends and family; surfing, playing music, day dreaming and hatching innocent schemes to catepult me into the next chapter of my ongoing saga.  

Music .woke in me a passion to create and communicate with something bigger than my world.  

I studied Cognitive Science and Applied Mathematics at The University of San Diego California. There I would participate in student government for my corriculum serving on the Student body board as Vice President as well as founding and participating in auxilary student clubs such as Sailing.  

After University I moved to San Francisco to work in Technology. As a project manager I lead teams to assemble internet enabled systems for climate control.  

Later I would work in Data Analytics for advertising and marketing.
