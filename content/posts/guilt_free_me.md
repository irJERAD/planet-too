## The Lamd  

God's master piece, his greatest gift; his son Jesus Christ of Nazareth lived and died on earth.  

His sacrifice was a gift of love and one of time. two millenia ago, just like today, culture and society were going through rapid social political shifts. It could have appeared as though the end were coming if you were there yourself. The ground shook, temple floor cracked.  

The son of God, set to live as a man. Was there and able to understand human nature. He walked like a man, ate like one and met others just like you or I.  

It could be thought that he was perhaps preparing to take a place with his father in the judgement of mankind - after all, a perfect, all knowing being that created the heavens and earth could find it difficult to understand why it was that given something so beautiful as free will, some would want to waste it on themselves and spoil it on things of this world or a night of wine and entertainment.  

The the human experience his son would provide him with a worldly view. He could understand how simple it is to forget and have something *so* spiritually important slip from the mind of a hardworking father.  

Something happened though, this boy became a man. He did what we men do, we find ourselves and what we lack in others around us. We find something greater than ourselves when we huddle around a fire to share our meals. Then, as the flame cracks the simple stories of their journeys become timeless legends of true insight and sentiment.  

This gave his son purpose here. A reason to stay and call it home. He made a family.  

To his family he was a teacher of the highest regard. The stories he would share with those who walked with him ignited something so powerful they would drop their lives after a single night listening to him and then give up their lives to be baptized by him.  

The belonging he felt in his family gave him a new purpose. He was no longer here to stand beside his father at the end and judge. He would not need to explain or understand our mistakes, he would not need to investigate our sin or deliberate on the nature of his friend's life style choices. He came and fell in love.  


Instead of coming to know, he would come to be. When God's son lived as man he did not see the filth or shame. He did not focus on the hopeless guilt. He saw beauty. The world built by man inspired him. Resting with some friends to share a meal and glass of wine, freeing yourself from the labors of your time and exchanging lessons with each other was what he lived through.  

His love for humanity grew so powerfully that when it was time for him to leave, he could no longer stomach the fact that he had come here to understand in order to help his father pass judgement in the end.  

With all his spiritual force he made a lasting gesture. He would leave this life by taking sin from all those he new. He refused to believe the nice men and women he met would be spending eternity in hell. His consious and loving spirit would not sit well with it. So he made a promise.  

He promised that he would lift the burden of sin from all those he met and would meet. Those who knew them could find solace in the fact that their sins would not remove them from ever lasting life in the garden.  

After his painful and publicly shaming death. It was said that he rested for three days in his tomb; that after waking his spirit traveled to share his message.  

His devoted followers crafted a special set of lesson they would ritualize. Similar to other spiritual forms of both, mind, spirit calibration the could use their training and some tools with certain chemical properties
