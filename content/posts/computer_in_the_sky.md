### Sky Cities Mainframe  

Computer in the sky  

Earth's atmosphere being used like a giant computer  
or a server that could virtualize many individual computers (hyper visor)  

### Galactic Gas  

Now see the black hole(s) at center of milky way galaxy  
They have gas all around  

Talked about as a relay station for the galactic TV show  

Turns out Fluoride and hydrogen are a common enough gas around this area  

Flouride is good for moving oxygen and for liquid breathing in gas breathing animals  

Liquid breathing uses liquid to transfer oxygen to parts of the body rather than the lungs breathing air and iron carrying oxygen
