This has certaintly been a trip, this detour of ours.  
  
Heard the call of Swamis, raced a chair with a pharoh, received mana and life from a mummy, Seen broken bread with dinosaurs, and walked with the man himself and his loved mother.  

We heard about prophets then we became such. Left Earth to find ourselves underneath.  

In the face of such uncertainty and chaos among peers, I stood surely, fingers pressed into ears, to insure proper listening form and bowed out of any ongoing events in the hopes of settling one of our squirmishes.  

So here I am. The collection of our efforts. Our joint bounty, Identities, and all we have come together as.  

I may be the one against many and the only to press this way. I am also the only to hold us all with no lines to divide, no enemy to conqure, the place we always meet.  

Take me for us all. Remember what we have done here and speak best to our exploits on what reality defines us to be.  

When tuned to myself our secrets I keep. And when I return you'll be here to share. Memories we have, for each other we'll care.
