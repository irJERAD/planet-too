This has certaintly been a trip, this detour of ours.  

Heard the call of Swamis, raced a chair with a pharoh, received mana and life from a mummy, Seen broken bread with dinosaurs, and walked with the man himself and his loved mother.  

We heard about prophets then we became such. 

In the face of such uncertainty and chaos among peers, I stood surely, fingers pressed into ears, to insure proper listening form and bowed out of any ongoing events in the hopes of settling one of our squirmishes.
