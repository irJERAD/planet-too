5-HT type-2 receptors: Mood regulation  
DA type-2 receptors: Attention  
AT2: Regulation of fluid and electrolytes

Serotonin for emotion and tripping out telepathically
MK-ultra  

DA for attention  

Neuropeptides small proteins produced by neurons, the modulation of amine and amine acide neurotransmitter.  

## The Nervous System  

Our nervous system is composed of over a hundred neurotransmitters.  

Two very important transmitters are **seratonin** and **dopamine**.  

These transmitters are involved in regulating mood and attention respectively.  

The primary form and function of each is rather well known.  

There is, however, a type-2 receptor for each of these molecules.  

Each type-2 receptor is less known functionally and mechanically.  

Seratonin works by being released from a transmitter and upon reception firing a network responsible for happiness. Since seratonin is a particularly expensive compound to forge in the neuron, it is recycled by the reuptake system after being after being released by the denrite and received by the receptor.  

The 5-HT2 receptor is of particular importance because it is specially activated during the use of LSD. The activation of this particular receptor is thought to be responsible for the halucinagenic affects of this drug.  
The radical experiences such as dimensional shifts in sensation as well as "collective tripping" and **"Contact High"** are all affiliated with the seratonin 5-HT2 receptor.  

The CIA research with MK-Ultra and other telepathic and psychic experiments center on the activation of the seratonin 5-HT2.
